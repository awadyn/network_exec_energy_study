Parsing and Analyzing Low-Level Execution Signals 
in Reference to Overall System Performance and Energy Consumption
-----------------------------------------------------------------
X_qps/...
	--> per-QPS directories of per-core log data
X_Y_counters_merged/
	--> per-QPS and per-DVFS directories of merged per-core logs for different explored ITR-delay values
	--> the data in these logs represents counter-based metrics read at a millisecond-scale interval
		--> a correct representation of this data is that of diffs between different counter readings
X_Y_non_counters_merged/
	--> per-QPS and per-DVFS directories of merged per-core logs for different explored ITR-delay values
	--> the data in these logs represents non_counter-based metrics read at a microsecond-scale interval
